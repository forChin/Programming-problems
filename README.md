## FAANG
[The faang package](https://github.com/forChin/Programming-problems/tree/master/src/faang) contains programming problems/questions that FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) companies use for interviews. At least that's what the internet says...

There are not only FAANG problems in this package, but also problems from companies like Airbnb, Adobe, Snapchat and others.
